The dataset utilized in this project represents a subset of songs
derived from the Genius Song Lyrics Dataset\textsuperscript{\cite{geniusdataset}}.
The dataset contains 11 attributes
that represent various song data, including the lyrics.
The original dataset includes songs in all languages: for our aim
we will be using the english ones only.\\

The dataset doesn't have emotion labels, which are essential for training the models.
To create the ground truth, the model
Albert Base v2\textsuperscript{\cite{albert-base-v2}} was used, classifying
stanzas' lyrics with Plutchik's eight primary emotions.

% The stanzas are labeled using Robert Plutchik's 8 primary emotions;
% the emotions included in this representation are:
% anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and joy.
% Such multifaceted emotions allow us to finely analyze the feelings and
% moods conveyed by songs.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}
This study focuses on capturing emotional dynamics in song lyrics by assigning
emotion labels to individual stanzas rather than entire songs.
This approach allows for a more granular analysis of emotional shifts within
the text.
The emotion labels correspond to Robert Plutchik's eight primary emotions \cite{plutchik1980general}
(shown in figure~\ref{fig:primary_emotions}), providing a comprehensive range
for representing various emotional states.\\

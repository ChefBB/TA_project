\section*{Motivation and project goal}
% Songs have the unique ability to engage people in ways that few other
% mediums can match. While beats and melodies contribute to this impact,
% it is often the lyrics that give songs their true emotional strength.
% Lyrics serve as one of the main foundations of songs, playing
% a crucial role in expressing feelings in many different ways.
% Analyzing the emotional tone of song texts can give useful insights about individual mental states,
% cultural trends, social issues and more.\\
% The main goal of this project is to perform emotion detection on stanzas of songs.
This project's goal is the development of various Machine Learning models that perform 
emotion detection on songs' lyrics.\\
The emotional tone of songs can be useful
for many things, such as automatized playlist creation, or songs' organization,
offering an alternative to the more traditional genre-based classification.\\
To obtain a deeper understanding of
emotional fluctuations within the texts,
the models assign emotion labels
to individual stanzas instead of full songs.
The emotional classification is based on Robert Plutchik's eight primary emotions
(shown in figure~\ref{fig:primary_emotions}),
offering a comprehensive range for representing diverse emotional states.\\

% Furthermore, we intend to compare different textual preprocessing and
% Machine Learning models, in order to explore different possibilities and
% evaluate their performances.


\section*{Dataset overview}
The dataset utilized in this project represents a subset of songs
derived from the Genius Song Lyrics Dataset\textsuperscript{\cite{geniusdataset}}.
The dataset contains 11 attributes
that represent various song-related information, including the lyrics.
The original dataset includes songs in all languages; this work focused
solely on English-language songs.\\

The dataset originally didn't contain emotion labels, essential for training the models.
To create the ground truth, the model
Albert Base v2\textsuperscript{\cite{albert-base-v2}} was used, classifying
stanzas' lyrics into Plutchik's eight primary emotions.
Due to the limited computational power, this process was time-intensive,
utlimately resulting in a limited dataset.

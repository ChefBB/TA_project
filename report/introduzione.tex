\section*{Motivation and project goal}
Songs have the unique ability to engage people in ways that few other
mediums can match. While beats and melodies contribute to this impact,
it is often the lyrics that give songs their true emotional strength.
As a matter of fact, lyrics serve as the foundation of songs, playing
the crucial role of expressing complex human emotions and moods in many
different ways.

Despite this, the general tendency is to focus more on song genres, themes,
or artists, rather than on the specific emotions conveyed through lyrics.
But by analyzing the emotional tone of song texts, people could actually gain
valuable insights into cultural trends, social issues, and individual mental
states. Furthermore, this type of analysis could help identify how specific
emotional responses are evoked, making it a useful tool across various fields.

Therefore, the main goal of this project would be to perform an emotion
detection task of each stanza of the songs in the selected dataset, so as
to gain a deeper understanding of the fluctuations of the emotions inside the
songs. Furthermore, we intend to compare different textual preprocessing and
Machine Learning models, in order to explore some different possibilities and
evaluate their performances.

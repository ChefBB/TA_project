%\section*{Motivation and project goal}

Songs have the unique ability to engage people in ways that few other mediums can match. 
%While beats and melodies contribute to this impact,
% it is often the lyrics that give songs their true emotional strength.
Lyrics serve as one of the main foundations of songs, playing a crucial role in
expressing feelings in many different ways.
The emotional tone of songs can serve various purposes, such as
automatized playlist creation or songs' organization,
offering an alternative to the more traditional genre-based classification. \\
%Analyzing the emotional tone of song texts can give useful insights about individual mental states, cultural trends, social issues and more.
% The main goal of this project is to perform emotion detection on stanzas of songs.
The goal of this project is the development of 4 Machine Learning models
that perform emotion detection on songs' stanzas. To obtain a deeper
understanding of emotional fluctuations within the texts, the models assign
emotion labels to individual stanzas instead of full songs.
The emotion labels correspond to Robert Plutchik's eight primary emotions
(shown in figure~\ref{fig:primary_emotions}), providing a comprehensive range
for representing various emotional states.\\

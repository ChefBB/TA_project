\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}
Lyrics serve as one of the main foundations of songs, playing a crucial role in
expressing feelings in many different ways.
The emotional tone of songs can serve various purposes, such as
automatized playlist creation or songs' organization,
offering an alternative to the more traditional genre-based classification. \\
%Analyzing the emotional tone of song texts can give useful insights about individual mental states, cultural trends, social issues and more.
% The main goal of this project is to perform emotion detection on stanzas of songs.
% The goal of this project is the development of 4 Machine Learning models
% that perform emotion detection on songs' stanzas.
To obtain a deeper understanding of emotional fluctuations within the texts,
the models assign emotion labels to individual stanzas instead of full songs.
The emotion labels correspond to Robert Plutchik's eight primary emotions
(shown in figure~\ref{fig:primary_emotions}), providing a comprehensive range
for representing various emotional states.\\

The dataset used for the project is a set of lyrics of songs extracted
from the Genius Song Lyrics Dataset\textsuperscript{\cite{geniusdataset}}.
The dataset contains 11 attributes
that represent various song data, including the lyrics.
The original dataset includes songs in all languages: for our aim
we will be using the english ones only. 

\section{Ground Truth}
The dataset has no emotion label, which is needed for training the models.
To create the ground truth for models' training, the model
Albert Base v2\textsuperscript{\cite{albert-base-v2}} was used.
The stanzas are labeled using Robert Plutchik's 8 primary emotions;
the emotions included in this representation are:
anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and joy.
Such multifaceted emotions allow us to finely analyze the feelings and
moods conveyed by songs.

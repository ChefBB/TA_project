Analyzing the emotional tone of songs' texts can give insights into societal
trends and this information can be useful especially for recommendation
algorithms. This study focuses on developing four Machine Learning models - two Static Models
and two Neural Networks - to classify emotions conveyed in English song lyrics at the stanza level.
These were chosen for their proven effectiveness across various domains and
their diverse approaches, providing a thorough investigation of different
techniques and depths for emotion classification in text.
% Their different depths are also an important point of reflection, as they
% offer interesting insights into the level of complexity required for detecting
% emotional tones in complex pieces of text.

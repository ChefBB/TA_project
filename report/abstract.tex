\chapter*{Abstract}
Analyzing the emotional tone of songs texts can give insights into
societal trends and this information can be useful especially for recommendation
algorithms.
This study aims to build 4 Machine Learning models that classify
emotions expressed in English song lyrics at the stanza level; 
the emotion labels are given according to
Plutchik's 8 primary emotions.

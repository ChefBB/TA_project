In conclusion, this study aimed at demonstrating how emotion detection in song lyrics stanzas can provide valuable insights into the emotional landscape of music and how it can be implemented with Machine Learning models. 
These findings have practical applications, such as improving music recommendation systems and creating mood-based playlists. 
At the same time, the study faced challenges, particularly with interpreting ambiguous or context-dependent lyrics, which highlights opportunities for further research in this field.

Lyrics serve as one of the main foundations of songs, playing a crucial role in
expressing feelings in many different ways.
The emotional tone of songs can also serve various purposes, such as
automatized playlist creation or songs' organization,
offering an alternative to the more traditional genre-based classification.\\

This study focuses on developing four Machine Learning models - two Static Models
and two Neural Networks - to classify emotions conveyed in English song lyrics,
at the stanza level.
The models were chosen for their proven effectiveness across various domains and
their diverse approaches, providing a thorough investigation of different
techniques and depths for emotion classification in text.\\

The models were trained through transfer learning, by creating the ground truth
via an existing model. This proved to be a challenge, because of computational
complexity; additionally, the generated labels are imprecise and overlapping,
